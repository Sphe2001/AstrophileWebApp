### Astrophile Web App ###

This is a prototype app for a beauty clinic that give skin care services. We only focused on three services for this prototype. 
For the backend we used Springboot Maven project and Java as the language.
And for the frontend we used React with JavaScript and tailwind for CSS.

Please look at the project images on the "Astrophile Web App Images" folder, if you want to download the project and add more please add the admin site because we used postman to add services because
we didn't have enough time to create the admin site.

### Happy Coding ###
